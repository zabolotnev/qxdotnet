To compile and run it, download Qooxdoo SDK from "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-5.0.2-sdk.zip" and unpack it to "qooxdoo-5.0.2-sdk" directory here (e.g. directories at a root of the project must be "DemoApplication", "qooxdoo-5.0.2-sdk" and "source").
Also you need to download and install Python 2.7 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/
or
http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads/
Now open qxDotNet.sln in Visual Studio 2015 and run "DemoApplication" project.
